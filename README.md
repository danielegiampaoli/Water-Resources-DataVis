# Water Resources DataVis
Data Visualisation tool for displaying Eurostat data about evolution of water resources in Europe relative to climate change. It requires setting up a HTML server to run. This can be done via Python and terminal commands: python -m http.server. You can go to this server by going to the URL localhost:8000.

The code exploits the Enter, Update, Exit paradigm to update visualisations based on selected data.
